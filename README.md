# Quote of the Day (JavaScript)

This repo contains two versions of Quote of the Day example.

In the `browser` folder, there is an example demonstrating how to use `@azure/app-configuration-provider` and `@microsoft/feature-management` in your react app which will be run in the browser.

In the `nodejs` filder, there is an example demonstrating how to use `@azure/app-configuration-provider` and `@microsoft/feature-management` in your node.js server.

The Quote of the Day example showcases the use of variant feature flags from Azure App Configuration and the transmission of telemetry data to Application Insights.
